MaFOM is a simple online Ticketing System for events.

![homepage](ill/home.PNG)


It works by allowing users to register, login, view events, and buy tickets to the event.

A user can also create their own event for as little as nothing; üíØ free (A user can alternate roles between being an event attendee and a host)

The project was built in collab with my friend [Allan Abere](https://github.com/Allan70).
